Dairy

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), “calcium is required for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular signaling and hormonal secretion”.1

In Canada, nutrient recommendations (Dietary Reference Intakes [DRIs]) are established in collaboration with the U.S. by expert committees of the Institute of Medicine (IOM), who base their decision upon an extensive review of the available scientific evidence. For calcium, the recommended intakes have been determined as those necessary to maintain calcium balance and bone health.2

The calcium requirements for the different age categories are listed in the table below. While recommendations may differ from country to country, the DRIs are fairly consistent with most national and international recommendations. For instance, the IOM’s calcium requirement for adults is 1,000 mg per day,3 which is similar to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation.
